                Hi, I'm Hugo, and I have about 3 years experience in Digital
                Product Development from 3 startups (Seed & Development, Startup
                and Growth business stages respectively) serving in roles as
                Technical Product Manager, Full Stack Engineer, Front-End
                Engineer, UI / UX (Figma & Miro) and Cloud (3x AWS Certified)
                with Agile Scrum and Kanban product development framework.
              </p>
              <p className="my-4 font-medium">
                I strive to create value while living a meaningful and purpose
                driven life. I love to collaborate in order to solve complex
                problems in order to make a lasting impact. Experimentation,
                innovation, feedback, iteration and improvement are main drivers
                of my exhilarating passion to find disruptive and elegant
                solutions presented in delightful experiences.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium">
                I have done studies in BCom Informatics and BSc Computer
                Science, both incomplete degrees, and Iâ€™ve discovered, through
                practical work experience, on real products, where I add the
                most value. I combine my years of experience as Graphic Designer
                in my youth, with my communication skills gained through
                Counseling / Church Ministry, Analysis and Systems & Design
                Thinking from BCom Informatics studies, Technical Acumen from my
                IT experience and Software Product Engineering and Computer
                Science from my years as a Software Engineer into a role that
                focuses on bringing all areas of product development and
                business together to make remarkable and life-changing products
                that make a difference in peoples lives through servant
                leadership, collaboration and strong determination towards
                realizing a worthwhile vision. I thrive in a highly autonomous
                and collaborative environment where discovery, exploration and
                learning are highly valued through the three pillars of
                empiricism, namely Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation. I
                care deeply about truly connecting with fellow humans and
                building lasting relationships that are meaningful through
                empathy and love.
